# My Two-Week Journey Learning C

## Introduction

Embarking on a journey to learn the C programming language in two weeks has been both challenging and rewarding. C, a language with a rich history and a cornerstone in the world of software development, offers a unique blend of low-level programming and high-level constructs. This repository documents my learning process, key concepts, and projects developed along the way.

## Week 1: Foundations and Basics

### Day 1: Getting Started
- **Installed Development Environment:** Set up GCC and a code editor (VS Code) to begin coding in C.
- **Hello, World!**: Wrote my first C program, understanding the structure of a basic C program.
- **Topics Covered**: Data types, Variables, and Constants.

<!---### Day 2: Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements:** Explored `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
- **Loops:** Practiced `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Project:** Created a simple calculator using control structures.

### Day 3: Functions and Recursion
- **Functions:** Learned how to define and call functions in C.
- **Recursion:** Dived into the concept of recursion with factorial and Fibonacci examples.
- **Project:** Implemented a recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### Day 4: Pointers and Memory Management
- **Pointers:** Studied pointer variables, pointer arithmetic, and memory addresses.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Practiced `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
- **Project:** Developed a dynamic array using pointers and memory allocation functions.

### Day 5: Arrays and Strings
- **Arrays:** Understood the concept of arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Strings:** Manipulated strings using arrays of characters and built-in string functions.
- **Project:** Created a program to perform various string operations like concatenation, comparison, and reversal.

### Day 6: Structures and Unions
- **Structures:** Learned how to define and use structures to group related data.
- **Unions:** Explored unions and understood their memory-saving potential.
- **Project:** Implemented a simple employee management system using structures.

### Day 7: File I/O
- **File Handling:** Learned how to read from and write to files in C.
- **Project:** Developed a program to manage a simple inventory system with data stored in a file.

## Week 2: Intermediate Concepts and Projects

### Day 8: Advanced Pointers and Memory
- **Function Pointers:** Explored the use of pointers to functions.
- **Pointers to Structures:** Practiced accessing structure members using pointers.
- **Project:** Implemented a menu-driven program using function pointers.

### Day 9: Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List:** Created a singly linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Expanded to a doubly linked list, adding reverse traversal.
- **Project:** Built a student record management system using linked lists.

### Day 10: Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implemented Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Practiced Linear Search and Binary Search.
- **Project:** Created a program to manage a sorted list of products, with search functionality.

### Day 11: Stacks and Queues
- **Stacks:** Implemented stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queues:** Created a queue with basic enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Project:** Developed an expression evaluator using stacks.

### Day 12: Dynamic Data Structures
- **Trees:** Introduced to binary trees and basic tree operations.
- **Heaps and Hash Tables:** Explored heaps and basic hashing techniques.
- **Project:** Built a priority queue using a heap.

### Day 13: Error Handling and Debugging
- **Error Handling:** Learned about error codes, `errno`, and handling runtime errors.
- **Debugging:** Practiced debugging techniques using `gdb`.
- **Project:** Improved previous projects with robust error handling and debugging features.

### Day 14: Final Project and Reflection
- **Final Project:** Combined knowledge from the past two weeks to create a comprehensive C project (e.g., a mini banking system, or a command-line game).
- **Reflection:** Documented the challenges faced, the progress made, and the key takeaways from this intense learning experience.

## Conclusion

In these two weeks, I've gained a solid understanding of the C programming language, from the basics to more advanced topics. This repository serves as a testament to my learning journey, and I hope it inspires others who are starting their path in C programming. 

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. The journey of learning never truly ends, and I'm excited to see where C programming takes me next!
